#Weather Application
This project is a weather web application that uses React and various libraries to display weather information. The application allows the user to search for weather data for a specific city.

Main functions:

Search Interface: The user can enter the name of the city in the search field and press Enter to get weather data for that city.

Basic information display: After receiving the weather data, the application displays the name of the city, the current temperature, the weather status icon and other parameters such as humidity, wind speed and the perceived temperature.

Animation for rainy weather: The application has animation for the case when it rains. If the weather condition indicates rain or drizzle, a rain animation is displayed.

Forecast for the next few hours: To provide more detailed information about the weather, the application displays the forecast for the next few hours in the form of a slider, showing the time, weather icon and temperature for each hour.

Background change: Depending on the time of day (day or night), the background of the application changes to the appropriate one (day or night).

Error handling: If errors occur when receiving weather data, the application displays error information.

Loading indicator: While the weather data is being loaded, the loading indicator (CircularProgress) is displayed.

The technologies used in the OpenWeatherMap API project to obtain weather data, JavaScript, React, MUI and react-slick to create a user interface.
